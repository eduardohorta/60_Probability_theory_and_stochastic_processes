\begin{document}
Let $X$ be a random variable that satisfies $\Pr(X \leq a) = 1$ for some constant $a$.
Then, for $d < E[X]$,
\[
\Pr( X > d) \geq \frac{E[X] - d}{a - d}
\]



{\em Proof:}
Apply the Markov's inequality to the random variable $\tilde{X} = a-X$,
\[\Pr(X\leq d) = \Pr(\tilde{X}\geq a-d) 
\leq \frac{E[\tilde{X}]}{a-d} 
= \frac{a-E[X]}{a-d}.
\]

Hence
\[
\Pr(X> d) \geq 1 - \frac{a-E[X]}{a-d} = \frac{E[X]-d}{a-d}.
\]
