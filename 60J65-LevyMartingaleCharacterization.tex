\begin{mythm}[Levy's martingale characterisation]
Let $W(t), t\geq 0$, be a stochastic process and let $\mathcal{F}_t = \sigma(W_s,s\leq t)$ be the filtration generated by it. Then $W(t)$ is a Wiener process if and only if the following conditions hold:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $W(0)=0$ almost surely;
\item The sample paths $t \mapsto W(t)$ are continuous almost surely;
\item $W(t)$ is a martingale with respect to the filtration $\mathcal{F}_t$;
\item $|W(t)|^2-t$ is a martingale with respect to $\mathcal{F}_t$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{mythm}
