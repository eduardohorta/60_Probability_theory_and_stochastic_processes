Let $\lbrace X_i \rbrace$ be a sequence of random variables defined on a probability space $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},P)$ taking values in a separable metric
space $(Y,d)$, where $d$ is the metric.  Then we say the sequence
$X_i$ \emph{converges in probability} or \emph{converges in measure} to a random variable $X$ if
for every $\varepsilon>0$,
$$\lim_{i\rightarrow\infty}P(d(X_i,X)\geq\varepsilon)=0.$$
We denote convergence in probability of $X_i$ to $X$ by
$$X_i\stackrel{pr}{\longrightarrow} X.$$
Equivalently, $X_i\stackrel{pr}{\longrightarrow} X$ iff every subsequence of $\lbrace X_i\rbrace$ contains a subsequence which converges to $X$ almost surely.

\textbf{Remarks}.  
\begin{itemize}
\item Unlike ordinary convergence, $X_i\stackrel{pr}{\longrightarrow} X$ and $X_i\stackrel{pr}{\longrightarrow} Y$ only implies that $X=Y$ almost surely.
\item The need for separability on $Y$ is to ensure that the metric, $d(X_i,X)$, is a random variable, for all random variables $X_i$ and $X$.
\item Convergence almost surely implies convergence in probability but not conversely.
\end{itemize}
