\begin{document}
This paper developed techniques for analyzing the internal 
structure of distributed measurements. We introduced 
entanglement, which quantifies the extent to which a 
measurement is indecomposable. Entanglement can be shown 
to quantify context-dependence. Moreover, positive entanglement 
is necessary for a system to generate more information than the 
sum of its subsystems.  Along the way, we constructed the quale,
which geometrically represents the compositional structure of a 
distributed measurement. The information-theoretic approach 
developed here is dual, in a precise sense, to the algorithmic 
perspective on computation. Studying duals $\fm^\natural$ 
instead of mechanisms $\fm$ shifts the focus from \emph{what} 
the algorithm does to \emph{how} it does it: instead of 
analyzing rules we analyze functional dependencies. 

The intuition driving the paper is that the structure presheaf 
$\psheaf$ is an information-theoretic analogue of a tangent 
space. A particle moving in a manifold $X$ defines a vector 
field -- a section of the tangent space to $X$, which is a 
sheaf. The tangent vector at a point depends on the particle's 
location at ``nearby time-points'': it is computed by taking 
the limit of difference in positions at $t$ and $t+h$ as 
$h\rightarrow 0$. Similarly, a system performing a measurement 
generates a quale, a section of the structure presheaf 
consisting of ``nearby counterfactuals''. The quale is computed 
by applying Bayes' rule to determine which inputs could have led
to the output.\footnote{A counterfactual input is ``nearby'' to 
an output if it causes (leads to) that output.} How far this 
analogy can be developed remains to be seen.

Entanglement can be loosely considered as an 
information-theoretic analogue of curvature: the extent to 
which interactions within a system ``warp'' sections of 
$\psheaf$ away from a product structure. A related approach 
to geometrically analyzing the complexity of interactions was 
proposed in \cite{ay:06}. In fact, this project began as an 
attempt to reformulate \cite{bt:09} in terms of sheaf 
cohomology using ideas from \cite{ay:06}. We failed at the 
first step since the structure presheaf is not a sheaf. 
However, the failure was instructive since it is precisely 
the \emph{obstruction} to forming a sheaf that is of interest 
since it is the obstruction (entanglement) that quantifies 
indecomposability and context-dependence, and only systems 
whose measurements are entangled are able to generate more 
information than the sum of their subsystems.
