The proof of Bayes' theorem is no more than an exercise in substituting the definition of conditional probability into the formula, and applying the total probability theorem.
$$
\frac{\prob{B}\prob{E|B}}{\sum_i \prob{A_i}\prob{E|A_i}} =
\frac{\prob{E\cap B}}{\sum_i \prob{E\cap A_i}} =
= \frac{\prob{E\cap B}}{\prob{E}} = \prob{B|E}.
