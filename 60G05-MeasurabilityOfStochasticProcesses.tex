For a continuous-time stochastic process adapted to a given \PMlinkname{filtration}{FiltrationOfSigmaAlgebras} $(\mathcal{F}_t)_{t\in\mathbb{R}_+}$ on a measurable space $(\Omega,\mathcal{F})$, there are various conditions which can be placed either on its sample paths or on its measurability when considered as a function from $\mathbb{R}_+\times\Omega$ to $\mathbb{R}$. The following theorem lists the dependencies between these properties.

\begin{theorem*}
Let $(X_t)_{t\in\mathbb{R}_+}$ be a real valued stochastic process.
Then, $X$ is optional if it is adapted and right-continuous, it is predictable if it is adapted and left-continuous. Furthermore, each of the following properties implies the next.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $X$ is predictable.
\item $X$ is optional.
\item $X$ is progressive.
\item $X$ is adapted and jointly measurable.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem*}
