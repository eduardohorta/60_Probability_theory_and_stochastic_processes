\begin{document}
Let $E$ be a LCCB space (locally compact with a countable base; usually a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$) and $C_0(E) = C_0(E, \mathbb{R})$ be the space of continuous functions on $E$ that vanish at infinity.  (We may write $C_0$ as shorthand.)  A \emph{Feller semigroup} on $C_0(E)$ is a family of positive linear operators $T_t, t \geq 0$, on $C_0(E)$ such that 

\begin{itemize}
\item $T_0 = Id$ and $||T_t|| \leq 1$ for every $t \in T$, \emph{i.e.} $\{T_t\}_{t \in T}$ is a family of contracting maps; 
\item $T_{t+s} = T_t \circ T_s$ (the semigroup property); 
\item $\lim_{t \downarrow 0} ||T_tf - f|| = 0$ for every $f \in C_0(E)$.
\end{itemize}

A probability transition function associated with a Feller semigroup is called a \emph{Feller transition function}.  A Markov process having a Feller transition function is called a \emph{Feller process}.
