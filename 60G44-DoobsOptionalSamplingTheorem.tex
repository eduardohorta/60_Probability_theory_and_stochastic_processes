Given a filtered probability space $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},(\mathcal{F}_t)_{t\in\mathbb{T}},\mathbb{P})$, a process $(X_t)_{t\in\mathbb{T}}$ is a martingale if it satisfies the equality
\begin{equation*}
\mathbb{E}[X_t\mid\mathcal{F}_s]=X_s
\end{equation*}
for all $s<t$ in the index set $\mathbb{T}$. Doob's optional sampling theorem says that this equality still holds if the times $s,t$ are replaced by bounded stopping times $S,T$. In this case, the $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{F}_s$ is replaced by the collection of \PMlinkname{events observable at the random time $S$}{SigmaAlgebraAtAStoppingTime},
\begin{equation*}
\mathcal{F}_S=\left\{A\in\mathcal{F}:A\cap\{S\le t\}\in\mathcal{F}_t\textrm{ for all }t\in\mathbb{T}\right\}.
\end{equation*}
In discrete-time, when the index set $\mathbb{T}$ is countable, the result is as follows.

\newtheorem*{thm}{Doob's Optional Sampling Theorem}
\begin{thm}
Suppose that the index set $\mathbb{T}$ is countable and that $S\le T$ are stopping times bounded above by some constant $c\in\mathbb{T}$.
If $(X_t)$ is a martingale then $X_T$ is an integrable random variable and
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}[X_T|\mathcal{F}_S] = X_S,\ \mathbb{P}\textrm{ almost surely}.
\end{equation}
Similarly, if $X$ is a submartingale then $X_T$ is integrable and
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}[X_T|\mathcal{F}_S] \ge X_S,\ \mathbb{P}\textrm{ almost surely}.
\end{equation}
If $X$ is a supermartingale then $X_T$ is integrable and
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}[X_T|\mathcal{F}_S] \le X_S,\ \mathbb{P}\textrm{ almost surely}.
\end{equation}
\end{thm}


This theorem shows, amongst other things, that in the case of a fair casino, where your return is a martingale, betting strategies involving `knowing when to quit' do not enhance your expected return.

In continuous-time, when the index set $\mathbb{T}$ an interval of the real numbers, then the stopping times $S,T$ can have a continuous distribution and $X_S,X_T$ need not be measurable quantities. Then, it is necessary to place conditions on the sample paths of the process $X$. In particular, Doob's optional sampling theorem holds in continuous-time if $X$ is assumed to be right-continuous.
