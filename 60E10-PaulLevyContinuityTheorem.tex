\PMlinkescapeword{reciprocal}
Let $F_1,F_2,\dots$ be distribution functions with characteristic functions
$\varphi_1,\varphi_2,\dots$, respectively. If $\varphi_n$ converges pointwise
to a limit $\varphi$, and if $\varphi(t)$ is continuous at $t=0$, then
there exists a distribution function $F$ such that $F_n\rightarrow F$ \PMlinkname{weakly}{ConvergenceInDistribution}, and the characteristic function associated to $F$ is $\varphi$.

\textbf{Remark.} The reciprocal of this theorem is a \PMlinkescapetext{simple} corollary to the Helly-Bray theorem; hence $F_n\rightarrow F$ weakly if and only if $\varphi_n\rightarrow\varphi$ pointwise; but this theorem says something stronger than the sufficiency of that \PMlinkescapetext{proposition}: it says that the limit of a sequence of characteristic functions is a characteristic function whenever it is continuous at 0.
