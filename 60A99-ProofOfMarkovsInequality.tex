Define
$$
Y = \begin{cases}
  d & X \ge d \\
  0 & \text{otherwise} \\
\end{cases}.
$$
Then $0 \le Y \le X$.  Additionally, it follows immediately from the definition that $Y$ is a random variable (i.e., that it is measurable).  Computing the expected value of $Y$, we have that
$$
\mathbb{E}[X] \ge \mathbb{E}[Y] = d\cdot\mathbb{P}_{}\left\{X \ge d\right\},
$$
and the inequality follows.
